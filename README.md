Architect - Web application builder toolkit
===========================================

A collection of tools for building websites/applications using the Fabric tool.


### Notes

- py-github is included in the source as it's not available via py-pi and is needed for the github module. In future py-github2 will be used, however at this time it doesn't support deployment keys.
